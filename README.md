# Binpot

The statically compiled, cross architecture, Docker based, binaries pot.

## Usage

The usage is focused to build other Docker images.

For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.13
COPY --from=qmcgaw/binpot:helm /bin /usr/local/bin/helm
```

- The Docker image tags for `qmcgaw/binpot` follow the following formatting:
  - `:name` for the latest stable version of the program `name`
  - `:name-v0.0.0` for the semver version of the program `name`
- Each Docker image is based on [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) and only contain the binary program at the path `/bin`.
- Each Docker image and binary program is built for each of the possible CPU architecture supported by Docker, unless indicated otherwise.
- Each binary has permissions `500` (read and execute for the user owner)
- You can change the ownership in the `COPY` command using `--chown=1000` for example, without duplicating the binary in your Docker image layers.
- Each Docker image has an entrypoint `[ "/bin" ]` so you can run it as well

## How it works

1. For each program, a Dockerfile describes how to build it. The final binary is placed on a final [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) based Docker image. *Example:* `helm` has [`./dockerfiles/helm/Dockerfile`](dockerfiles/helm/Dockerfile)
2. For each program, a Github Action workflow is triggered when its Dockerfile or the workflow itself is changed. This workflow takes care of:
    1. Cross build the program for many CPU architectures
    2. Pushing the images containing the program to Docker Hub
